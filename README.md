# Dobby2


An emulator for reverse engineering obfuscated code built on top of Triton and Unicorn.
This was used to reverse engineer the workings of a AntiCheat kernel module.

This code is not intended to be a usable product for anyone but me. 
It is a bunch of helper tools that should have been refactored a long time ago.
Use at your own risk.
