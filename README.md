# Dobby2

An emulator for reverse engineering obfuscated code built on top of Triton and Unicorn.
This was originally created to reverse engineer a highly obfuscated AntiCheat kernel module.

This code is not yet intended to be a usable product for anyone but me. Feel free to reach out about it though.

This project is similar to (Qiling Framework)[https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling] or (Fireeye's Speakeasy)[https://github.com/fireeye/speakeasy]

A reason to use this and not one of those tools is the added power of a symbolic execution api, and because I wrote it and I like things I write.
